Startup Leadership Best Practices
================================
Purpose
-------
The purpose of this article is to document best practices for those with leadership positions within the organization. This is by no means a set of rules to follow, as every team is different. It is, however, strongly encouraged that every team, including the executive team, to consider and adopt the documented practices whenever possible.
Philosophy
__________
For a startup, or any organization in an unstable, fast moving industry, to operate is like navigating in the ocean. Any change in weather, current, and nearby ships may propel or ruin the ship. Thus, the organizational structure should attribute such an environment in its design.
Inspirations
------------
This document is heavily influenced by Sir Richard Branson’s approach for establishing and growing the Virgin Group. Agile Software Development manifesto also inspired many of the documented practices, with greater responsibility placed on the leader to follow through. Other inspirations include the Lean Startup Principles and 37Signals’ Rework. A minor influence is the Straw Hats crews within One Piece manga universe.
This document should be considered as a working document at all times and may be modified based on experiences and feedback.
Reporting Structure
-------------------
### There are no “Managers”, only “Leads” or “Leaders”
* Managers are outdated concepts from the industrial revolution, when business-as-usual is practical and beneficial. Neither of them are true for startups and the ever-changing environments of today.
* Project timeline and any other business conducted by the team should be owned and managed by the team. There may be assistances to help with bookkeeping, but that person should hold no authority over his or her peers.
* Managers without field experiences are more likely to make impossible demands and appeal upward than protecting their teams.
* If an employee cannot perform without being managed, that person does not belong on the team.
### No team member should be more than one reporting level away from the executive team
* Additional levels risk information loss, inefficient communication, and politics.
* If a team has grown to a point which requires another layer of reporting, the team should be split to its own organizations. This is a variation of Sir Richard Branson’s approach.
* Yes. The executive team is just another team.
### Leaders should follow up with their team members after each member’s first week, and monthly afterwards
### Organizations should avoid functional reporting structure
* Every team should have a sufficient range of talents in each area to maintain balanced product-market perspective
Planning
--------
### Product Direction, Sales Initiatives, Marketing Campaigns can be proposed by anyone in the organization, but are committed by the appropriate teams
* Direction of the team should be dictated by the team, not outsiders.
* Those outside of the team may offer ideas from different perspectives.
### Leaders may only dictate the direction in the event of a stalemate
* In many cases, team decisions are clear and can be communicated and negotiated. Those who refuse to discuss as a team should not be part of one.
* The main responsibility of a leader is to encourage the team to perform its best, not to dictate directions.
* If the gap of knowledge between the leader and the team is too great, it will not perform well.
* A leader may make the final decision to avoid prolonged discussions and hostility among the team.
### Plans should be scrapped every 6 months and reviewed every month
* The environment changes too quickly for yearly planning. If a plan takes longer than 6 months to implement, it will not be relevant by the time it’s done.
### Everyone in the organization should have the option to attend every planning meetings as a spectator
* To avoid prolonged discussions, spectators may only observe but not contribute during the meeting.
* This aims to promote information exchange and potential collaborations between the teams.
* If an employee, no matter at which position, cannot be trusted to observe planning meetings, that person should be not be part of the organization.
### Each team should be responsible for its own recruitment
* Recruiting a new team member is not trivial matter. If a position is not worth the team’s time and effort to find and fill, it should not be open.
* If an organization requires a HR department for recruitment, it’s too big.
Performance
-----------
### Teams will receive monthly cohesion budget for the activities, perks, and other related expenses
* This budget is meant to promote team efficiency as the results of team morale, unity, and happiness. Thus, the spending should be tracked against the performance of team.
### All the teams should have the same cohesion budget per team member, regardless of the position of that member
* No one team is more important than another. Unimportant teams should not be formed.
### Bonus rewards should be based on both team and individual performances and, when in doubt, value team over individuals
### Team performance should be measured in terms of dollars whenever possible
* Product features and customer support initiatives should be assigned dollar amount based on customer satisfaction and retention rate.
* Technical optimizations should be assigned dollar amount based on the reduced operational cost.
* Marketing campaigns should be assigned dollar amount based on lead throughput and downward conversion.
* Sales and business development initiatives should be assigned dollar amount based on customer conversions.
### Balancing the account should generate enough business insights to make BI analysts superfluous
